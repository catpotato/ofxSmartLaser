# ofxSmartLaser

## Intro

This code is based heavily on Memo's ofxIlda, and requires both ofxIlda and ofxEtherdream. 

ofxIlda took care of a lot of the headaces of sending points to the laser, but draws in an simple way that makes messy drawings.

ofxSmartLaser draws in a smart way to make clean drawings.
